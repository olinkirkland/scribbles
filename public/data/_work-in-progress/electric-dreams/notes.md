The Unchained want to steal an experimental device known as the Echo Core from the Sparkwrights’ heavily secured R&D facility. The device allows hulls to "hear" whispers from the Ghost Field, granting them advanced ghost detection and limited communication with spirits.
Key Factions and Motivations

    The Unchained
        Goal: Obtain the Echo Core to grant hulls a deeper connection to the Ghost Field and fuel their liberation movement. They believe this technology will help hulls break free from their oppressive servitude.
        Rumors: The Unchained believe the first free hull, a figure they call "Prometheus", used a prototype Echo Core to achieve sentience and freedom. They hope this new version will allow others to follow.

    The Sparkwrights
        Goal: Protect their intellectual property. The Echo Core is a highly classified project that could revolutionize ghost detection or become a devastating weapon in the wrong hands.
        Security: The facility is guarded by cutting-edge lightning barriers, Sparkcraft constructs, and possibly hull workers loyal to the Sparkwrights.

    The Spirit Wardens
        Goal: Prevent the technology from being stolen. They fear that empowering hulls with this device will destabilize Doskvol and lead to chaos in the Ghost Field, where spirits and hulls might unite against humanity.
        Presence: They are covertly monitoring the facility, prepared to intervene if necessary.

Score Locations

    Sparkwrights' R&D Facility
        A sprawling industrial complex lit by eerie blue glow from lightning barriers.
        Key areas:
            Testing Lab: Where the Echo Core is stored, surrounded by sensitive ghost-detection wards.
            Generator Room: Powering the lightning barriers and automated defenses.
            Hull Factory: A chilling assembly line where hulls are crafted, inspected, and imprinted with obedience protocols.

    Alternative Locations
        A Warehouse in Coalridge: Where the Unchained plan to smuggle the stolen Echo Core.
        The Dimmer Sisters' Estate: If the device is moved here for safe storage, the players might need to intercept it in this heavily haunted area.

Complications

    Hull Slavery: Sparkwrights employ hulls as guards and workers in the factory. Some hulls might be loyal to their masters, while others could be convinced to help the crew.
    Prometheus Rumors: Some say Prometheus still wanders the Ghost Field. Others claim he's the mind behind the Unchained. What’s the truth? Could his presence complicate the mission?
    Blade Runner References:
        Hull guards might question the crew with eerie quotes like, "Have you ever retired a spirit before?"
        The Echo Core emits faint, distorted whispers that eerily echo lines like, "I’ve seen things you people wouldn’t believe."

Questions for Refinement

    What’s the crew’s relationship with the Unchained?
        Are they sympathetic to their cause or simply taking the job for coin?

    What is the crew’s goal with the Echo Core?
        Deliver it to the Unchained, keep it for themselves, or sell it to a rival faction like the Hive or the Dimmer Sisters?

    What’s the tone of the hulls in the factory?
        Are they resigned to their servitude, or could a spark of rebellion arise if they encounter the Echo Core?

    What’s the ultimate fate of Prometheus?
        Is he dead, a myth, or still an active player in Doskvol’s underworld?

    Does the Echo Core have side effects?
        For example, could exposure to its whispers draw the attention of dangerous spirits?
