1. Receive the mission from Archer (calm, visionary), the life-like Hull. He meets you in a cluttered machine shop in Nightmarket, the headquarters of the Unchained.

2. The mission: Rescue Prometheus, who Archer believes is being held by the Sparkwrights. Prometheus is the original freed hull, the first to gain sentience. He holds the key to recovering Hull memories and restoring their spirits.

3. The target location: A secret Sparkwright facility beneath Charterhall. They are using Prometheus to create new Hulls from fragments of his memories. The facility is heavily guarded and protected by lightning barriers.
   - Testing Lab: The Sparkwrights are experimenting on bipedal Hulls, made of fragments of Prometheus' memories. They're trying to send them into the Ghost Field, but so far they haven't been successful.
     - A huge, ancient arch with a billowing cloth curtain stands in the center of the room.
     - New hulls are sent in at the end of a chain.
     - Glass cases with the preserved remains of failed experiments (Hulls that have been destroyed or altered). Placards on the cases describe the experiments.
   - Generator Room: The facility is powered by a massive electroplasmic generator.
   - Hull Factory: This is where the Sparkwrights are creating new Hulls. Prometheus is asleep, held in a glass chamber, connected to the machinery.
   - Hallways and Security: The facility is patrolled by Sparkwrights and "Fragments".
