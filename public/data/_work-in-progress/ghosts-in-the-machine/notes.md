Revealed Motive:

The parapsychologist claims that the grimoire holds forgotten knowledge on spirit control and protection, which could help him safely study ghostly phenomena. He insists he needs it to better understand spirits and prevent dangerous hauntings in the city.

Hidden Motive:

In reality, the parapsychologist seeks to unlock the secrets of a forbidden ritual buried in the grimoire’s margins—a ritual that would allow him to bind his own spirit to his body after death, granting him a twisted form of immortality. He plans to test this by experimenting on others first.
