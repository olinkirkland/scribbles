Each crew member's life hangs in the balance: Work for the empire or die! A special program has branched out from the Imperial City where dangerous prisoners are released with a choice: do dangerous, suicidal missions for the Empire and earn your freedom, or die trying. The crew is one such group of prisoners, and they must work together to survive (and possibly escape) the Empire's machinations.
