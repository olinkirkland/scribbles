I'm thinking about a score concept, looking for feedback. Just bullet points right now.

Ghosts in the Machine

    Parapsychologist Ryan Banks ("the Benefactor") hires you to retrieve a grimoire from an ancient library deep in the deathlands, a vast underground complex that's long been abandoned.


    Banks tells you the grimoire contains instructions on controlling spirits, which will let him safely understand how to prevent hauntings in Duskvol. What he doesn't tell you is that he wants to use that information to tie his soul to his body after death, essentially becoming immortal. And he probably wants to experiment on others first.


    The library itself is alive and sentient. It's become a trap like a carnivorous plant. Armored husks and traps lie in wait between the rooms and shelves.


    Reading books "feeds" the library; it sucks soul energy out of people who read within the book stacks. Previous explorer and scavenger corpses can be found clutching books?

I would make it a collection of books

    1. Obfuscate the reason for needing it
    2. This sounds like a score that needs a massive payout, and being able to sell some extra antique books definitely helps with that

I like the price for reading books. Something that might discourage characters from just randomly taking/reading stacks of books. Might just be "opens a book - roll resistance for becoming to obssessed to put it down, ever".

Play up the 'Spirit library' vibes by making it so that the library feels endless - You need to decipher the library's own variant of the dewey decimal system or attune to it in order to actually find your way.

your employer eagerly flipping open the book after paying you. You notice a single letter, like a tattoo, on his ear. Then another. Then another.

Could be that the reason the patron has learned of the book is the library was recently rediscovered by a Deathlands Scavengers crew who reported it to the Spirit Wardens and they're about to come in heavy and level the place for "safety reasons"
That means you could plausibly have DS and SW at the site, maybe a temporary excavation camp or something

Revealed Motive:

The parapsychologist claims that the grimoire holds forgotten knowledge on spirit control and protection, which could help him safely study ghostly phenomena. He insists he needs it to better understand spirits and prevent dangerous hauntings in the city.

Hidden Motive:

In reality, the parapsychologist seeks to unlock the secrets of a forbidden ritual buried in the grimoire’s margins—a ritual that would allow him to bind his own spirit to his body after death, granting him a twisted form of immortality. He plans to test this by experimenting on others first.
